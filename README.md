# leveldb-handbook-english
This is the english translation of the original Chineese Analysis leveldb source code step by step by gary rong @rjl493456442

The original Leveldb-handbook was based on the goleveldb project, and told the reader, in chineese the system structure and design principles behind leveldb.

The author just kept recording and learning in the process of reading the source code. It is a great tool in understanding how  leveldb works and also illustrates  many ideas from Google's BigTable database.
